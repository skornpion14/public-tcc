<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 6, 2026</p>
<p>At <strong>Travel Currency Converter</strong>, we value your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our mobile application distributed through the Google Play Store.</p>
<h2 id="1-information-we-collect">1. Information We Collect</h2>
<h3 id="user-provided-information">User-Provided Information</h3>
<p>We do not require you to create an account or provide any personally identifiable information (such as name, email, or address) to use the basic features of the application.</p>
<h3 id="automatically-collected-information-third-parties-">Automatically Collected Information (Third Parties)</h3>
<p>To provide certain features and monetize the application, we use third-party services that may collect information:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> Used to display advertisements. AdMob may collect and use data such as your device&#39;s advertising ID (GAID), app usage data, and IP address to show relevant ads and perform analytics. You can manage your advertising preferences in your device&#39;s Google settings.</li>
<li><strong>Google Play Store (Payments):</strong> When you make an in-app purchase to disable ads, the payment process is managed entirely by Google Play. We do not have access to your credit card data or financial information. We receive a transaction confirmation to activate the &quot;Pro&quot; version without ads.</li>
<li><strong>Currency Exchange Services:</strong> The app queries external APIs (such as open.er-api.com) to obtain current exchange rates. These requests may include standard network metadata (such as your IP address) required for technical communication.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-use-of-information">2. Use of Information</h2>
<p>We use the collected information to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide and maintain the application.</li>
<li>Process your purchases to disable ads.</li>
<li>Show relevant ads through AdMob (in the free version).</li>
<li>Improve the stability and performance of the application.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-local-storage">3. Local Storage</h2>
<p>The application uses your device&#39;s local storage (Preferences/localStorage) to save your currency preferences (e.g., the last selected currency). This data remains exclusively on your device and is not sent to our servers.</p>
<h2 id="4-user-rights">4. User Rights</h2>
<p>Depending on your location, you may have rights under laws such as GDPR (Europe) or CCPA (California). Since we do not collect personal data directly, the best way to exercise your rights regarding data collected by third parties is through your Google account settings or your mobile device settings.</p>
<h2 id="5-children-s-privacy">5. Children&#39;s Privacy</h2>
<p>Our application is not specifically directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>
<h2 id="6-changes-to-this-policy">6. Changes to this Policy</h2>
